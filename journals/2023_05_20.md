- Under the influence of strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you are hanging out near a massive object, you'll experience the effect of time going slower.
- But Gravity isn't the only thing that can warp time, according to Einstein's theory of special relativity time slows down for an object when it moves
- The greater the acceleration of an object the slower it will move through the time. That's why in the black hole time is slowed to a halt where the gravity is so humongous not even time can escape, not even light.
