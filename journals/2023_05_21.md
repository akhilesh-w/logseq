- "We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience" understanding "means that the various parts of the information acquired are grasped in their relation to one another-a result that is attained only when acquisition is accompanied by constant reflection upon the meaning of what is studied. "When we reflect upon an experience instead of just having it, we inevitably distinguish between our own attitude and the objects toward which we sustain the attitude... Such reflection upon experience gives rise to a distinction of what we experience (the experienced) and the experiencing-the how." [[Daily Journal]]
