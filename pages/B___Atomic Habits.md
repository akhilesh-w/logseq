- What are habits?
	- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
	- But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.
- Favorite highlights

- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your cluster is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat
