- What are habits?
	- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
	- But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.
- Favorite highlights
- Success is the product of daily habits - not once-in-lifetime transformation.
- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your cluster is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

- Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room:
- *“When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”*

- Adopt a systems-first approach instead of focusing on goals
	- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
	- *You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.*
- To form good habits, make them a part of your identity
	- Our habits should be a part of our identity and the starting point of building it. Most of us get this wrong – we start with outcomes and work backwards towards our identity. But when a habit comes from who we are, it serves as the best form of intrinsic motivation.
		- - The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
		- - The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
		- - The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.
	- *Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.*
	- *Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.*
