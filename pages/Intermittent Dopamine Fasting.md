- *Intermittent dopamine fasting helps you do more "boring but high-value" activities more easily.*
- To go on an intermittent dopamine fast means to **delay, reduce or outright avoid** **high-dopamine, low-value activities** such as:
	- Scrolling through Instagram
	- Scrolling though Reddit
	- Scrolling Twitter
	- Binge watching youtube
	- Drinking Coffee
-
- That's because **"boring but high-value" low-dopamine activities** such as...
	- Meditating
	- Reading
	- Writing
	- Working
	- Focusing
	- Facing fears
	- Connecting with people
	- Solving hard problems
- become **that much harder after you're already dopamine-triggered** early on in your day.
- Think about it: Once you've had that dopamine hit early on from the news or Instagram, that tediuous (but important) report you wanted to write is now utterly and mindnumbingly *boring.*

- ## Your Daily Dopamine Threshold
- For example, if you check Instagram early in the morning, thus getting your first hit of dopamine, any tedious but important work like reading will just not be attractive anymore.
- You just won't do it.
- Because once you had that hit, **you've created the minimum dopamine threshold** for that day. Anything below that threshold will not happen.
- However, if you can delay the first intense hit of dopamine for as long as possible, "boring" stuff like reading becomes much more attractive.
- It's much more likely that you'll do it and enjoy it!
