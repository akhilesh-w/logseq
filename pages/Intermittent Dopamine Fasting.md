- *Intermittent dopamine fasting helps you do more "boring but high-value" activities more easily.*
- To go on an intermittent dopamine fast means to **delay, reduce or outright avoid** **high-dopamine, low-value activities** such as:
	- Scrolling through Instagram
	- Scrolling though Reddit
	- Scrolling Twitter
	- Binge watching youtube
	- Drinking Coffee
-
- That's because **"boring but high-value" low-dopamine activities** such as...
	- Meditating
	- Reading
	- Writing
	- Working
	- Focusing
	- Facing fears
	- Connecting with people
	- Solving hard problems
- become **that much harder after you're already dopamine-triggered** early on in your day.
- Think about it: Once you've had that dopamine hit early on from the news or Instagram, that tediuous (but important) report you wanted to write is now utterly and mindnumbingly *boring.*
