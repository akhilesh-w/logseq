- The word *Zettelkasten* in German means "slip box" or "note box".
- A Zettelkasten is a collection of atomic, integrated, and linked notes from various sources of learning.
- This concept was popularized by the German sociologist  [[Niklas Luhmann]] , who famously gave his own Zettelkasten the credit for his ability to produce many academic books and articles in a short period of time.
- A  [[Zettel]]  is a single note in a Zettelkasten, and represents a distilled and distinct concept.
