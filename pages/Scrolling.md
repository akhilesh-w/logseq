- I believe it's **no co-incidence** how similar slot-machines and "scrolling-based" websites like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook work. I believe that at the core, they're almost the same and are designed to trigger dopamine hikes and thus become irresistible.

- ## The "Arm"
- On a slot-machine, you have the "arm" to the side that you need to pull down vertically. On a website you have either the scrollbar which you must pull or use a finger in a similar vertical swiping.

- ## The "Blur"
- On a clasic slot-machine you have three or more reels that "spin" and blur the icons (cherry, coin, etc.) vertically. The same, albeit with only one reel, happens on a website like Instagram. By scrolling, you create a vertical blur that eventually, hopefully, displays something "good."
