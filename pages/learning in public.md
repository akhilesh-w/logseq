- Show your work as you go along because we are all [[amateurs]] just trying to figure things out. This means that you are open and public about what you are working on and what you are figuring out. Find a public platform to show off works in progress even if they are rough and incomplete. I’ve always found that rough sketches and unrefined visual work has a raw energy and honesty that is often missing in completed and packaged work.

- This goes by many names and phrases. [[Austin Kleon]] wrote an entire book called “Show Your Work!”. [[Andy Matuschak]] says to [“work with the garage door up”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) based on story by [[Robin Sloan]] about a woodworking shop that always had the door open so people could see what was going on inside. [[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] says [“work in public”](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public). I also like the phrase “thinking out loud” too.
- Most of all, I like the term **learning in public**. We are always learning. Create to understand what you know. Sharing discoveries with others.
