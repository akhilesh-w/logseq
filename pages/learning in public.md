- Show your work as you go along because we are all [[amateurs]] just trying to figure things out. This means that you are open and public about what you are working on and what you are figuring out. Find a public platform to show off works in progress even if they are rough and incomplete. I’ve always found that rough sketches and unrefined visual work has a raw energy and honesty that is often missing in completed and packaged work.
- Have a blog. Post on social media platforms. Regular schedule. Journal. Photos. Sketch Dumps. Show your sketchbook. Leave a record. Get it on the page](https://mister-chad.com/creativity/get+it+on+the+page). [Write to understand](https://mister-chad.com/creativity/write+to+understand).
