- ### `Var`   versus   `let`
- ```JavaScript
  var camper = "James";
  var camper = "David"; // Doesn't throw an error
  
  let camper = "James";
  let camper = "David"; // Does throw an error
  ```
-
- var and let
- Unless you know what you’re doing, keep `var` afar and bet on `let`.
	-
	- var: assigns
	- without var: assigns with global scope
	- let: want to change
	- const: anything else
	- = to assign
	- + for concatenation
	- Primitives
	- Compound
	- Arrays [1, 2, 3]
	- Objects {} - Key + Name
	- myVar += 5 – Add and assign
