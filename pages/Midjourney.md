- Midjourney is a small startup that uses [[AI]]  to generate images in a variety of styles and subjects, according to users' prompts. The only way to use Midjourney is to install the Midjourney bot to a Discord server.
-
- ### Usage
	- On Discord, type `/imagine`. If the Midjourney bot is installed and enabled on the channel, a dialog box should appear from Midjourney.

- ## Tips for using Midjourney
- ### Set default settings
- Use `/settings` to set some default settings so that you don't have to include them in your prompts each time.
	- `--q 0.5` halves the quality of the initial output to save you time.
	- `--v 4` to use the latest version of Midjourney
